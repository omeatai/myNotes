# Pullback trading is one of the most popular forms of trading amongst traders.
# It has been used in the Forex, Options, Equity and Commodities markets for many

#
# A pullback, also referred to as a retracement or consolidation, is a small temporary

# Trading Strategy Series he describes the 2 Period RSI Pullback strategy.
#
# The strategy consists of 9 basic rules, some of which we cannot directly reproduce,
# so I have had to adapt these rules to suit ProfitTrailer's current capabilities and for
# intraday trading as follows:
#
# 1. The trading pair must be in a long term uptrend according to the 200 day moving average;
# 2. The trading pair must have high volume;
# 3. The trading pair must have good volatility according to the 100 day moving average;
# 4. The trading pair must be in a strong uptrend;
# 5. The trading pair is currently down in price;
# 6. The trading pairs price must be down at least a defined percentage;
# 7. The 2 period RSI must be below 20;
# 8. Buy on a lower intraday price opportunity;
# 9. Exit the trade when the 2 period RSI is over 70.

# You will need to purchase his books to see the original rules if you want to compare these.
