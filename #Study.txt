Hello,
There are two (2) updates I would like to make to my application:
1. After I had applied for my visiting visa (to visit my sister and fiancee in Canada) of which I am still awaiting approval, my fiancee "UKAMAKA NWAKAKU MADUAGWU" successfully took some time off work and briefly came down to Nigeria to begin our marriage plans. During the period, we got married officially on the 27th of September, 2022, at the Marriage Registry here in Abuja, and also had a ceremonial Church wedding on the 1st of October, 2022. Therefore, I would like to update my application changing the reason for my visit from "to see my fiancee" to "to visit my wife and spend our honeymoon together in Canada". I would also like to provide evidences to prove our marriage at your request.
2. After my wife got back to Canada, she was able to get a new job offer at Lethbridge, Alberta, and she has since relocated and started work. Therefore, I would like to update her residential address from Calgary, Alberta to Lethbridge, Alberta. Here is her new address:  {street name, street number, city, province, postal code and country}
