OS & SYS MODULES

import os

#Getting Current Working Directory
print(os.getcwd())

#Creating a Directory
os.mkdir('new_dir')

#Changing the Current Working Directory
dir_ = os.getcwd()
os.chdir(f'{dir_}/new_dir')
print(os.getcwd())

#Change CWD to Parent
os.chdir('..')
print(os.getcwd())

#Remove Directory
dir_ = os.getcwd()
os.rmdir(f'{dir_}/new_dir')

#List Files and Sub-directories
dir_ = os.getcwd()
print(os.listdir(dir_))

os.walk


 
#sys.argv
import sys

#sys.version – This stores the information about the current version of python.
print(sys.version)

#sys.path – Path variable stores the directory path in the form of a list of strings.
#sys.path.append('/root/test/')
print(sys.path)

#sys.platform – Prints the os platform type. This function will be very useful when you run your program as a platform dependent.
print(sys.platform)

#sys.maxsize – This is an integer value representing maximum value a variable can hold.
print(sys.maxsize)

#sys.argv – argv is used to pass run time arguments to your python program. Argv is a list that stores the script name as the 1st value followed by the arguments we pass. Argv values are stored as type string and you have to explicitly convert it according to your needs.
#print("You entered: ",sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2], sys.argv[3])
print(sys.argv)

#sys.exit – Exit the interpreter by raising SystemExit(status). By default, status is said to be Zero and is said to be successful. 
print(sys.exit)












FILE I/O

* strip(): returns a new string after removing any leading and trailing whitespaces including tabs (\t).
* rstrip(): returns a new string with trailing whitespace removed. It’s easier to remember as removing white spaces from “right” side of the string.
* lstrip(): returns a new string with leading whitespace removed, or removing whitespaces from the “left” side of the string.

Python Interpreter converts code into a form the computer will understand.

Types of Python Interpreters:
- CPython
- IronPython
- Jython
- PyPy
- PythonNet

Differences btw Scripts and Modules
Module is designed to be imported while script is written directly to be executed.

OS module - portable way of using os dependent functionalities.

Files - Named location on a disk to store information.
File descriptor object is formed when you create a file.

open, close, read, write
Modes:
R - read
W - write
A - append
T - open in text mode
B - open in binary mode
- rb, r+, rb+
- w, wb, w+, wb+
- a, ab, a+, ab+  
- x, x+

fd.read()
fd.seek() - Sets the cursor back to another position.
fd.tell() - Tells current position of the cursor.

print(line, end = “”)

readline = read line content till next line

print(fd.readline())
print(fd.readlines())
print(fd.writeline())
print(fd.writelines())
readable
writable
